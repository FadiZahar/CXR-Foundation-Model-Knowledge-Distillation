    "### Foundation Model Knowledge Distillation (FMKD) for Chest X-Rays (CXR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to develop a robust, distilled reconstruction of foundation models (FMs) that maintains performance on par with the original models and provides a practical means to explore and potentially mitigate inherent bias issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this work is on Googleâ€™s proprietary CXR Foundation Model (CXR-FM), which was trained on 821,544 labelled and mostly private chest X-rays (CXRs). In this context, the task of disease detection using CXRs from the publicly available CheXpert dataset will first be explored first.\n",
    "\n",
    "***First Goal:*** Leverage the embeddings from CXR-FM, the teacher model, to train a student model using Knowledge Distillation (KD). This process utilises a subset of the CheXpert dataset as a transfer set to align the features of the student model with those of the teacher model.\n"
